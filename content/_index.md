jeefy's primary role at Red Hat involves developing and maintaining the CI system used to gauge product health for the OpenShift Dedicated platform. When not poking holes at test plans, he can usually be found working on upstream Kubernetes in various sub-projects or posting an unhealthy amount of GIFs on Twitter. 

He is a Goose Enthusiast and enjoys referring to himself as a Michigander.
