## Hello Friend

I'm Jeff! Pretty much every where on the internet I'm known as `@jeefy`

<img src="/images/cncf.png" width="20px" style="display: inline;"/> I focus on developer experience and programs at the CNCF, and enjoy presenting on and evangelizing cloud native technologies and open source software.

<img src="/images/kubernetes.png" width="20px" style="display: inline;"/> Often I can be found working on upstream [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) in various sub-projects or posting an unhealthy amount of GIFs on Twitter.

<img src="/images/goose.png" width="20px" style="display: inline;"/> I'm a [Goose Enthusiast](https://honk.ci) and enjoy referring to myself as a Michigander.... even if I now live in Minnesota.

I'm an open book! Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or have questions.
